## Welcome to Jackson Hayes's tips and tricks site
A place to learn and share best practices in software development as well as how to use time saving tools for software developers. 

The primary focus will be to developers of the GAMESS, Libcchem, and JuliaChem computational chemistry packages, but other general material will be posted here. New content will be shared in the #tips-and-ticks channel of the GAMESS-US slack. 

Guest content is welcome. Feel free to make a pull request and I will add your content!
